// an easier way to prevent cramming your code with \ is to use ' as the surrounding quotes. The string will use the same type of quote as the starting and ending marker. If you are going to use a lot of one quotation mark, use the other to encompass the strings

var myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';
