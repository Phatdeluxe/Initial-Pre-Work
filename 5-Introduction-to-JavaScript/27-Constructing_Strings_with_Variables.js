// you can concatenate a variable into a string so that you can add user input into a pre-built sentence

// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Ethan";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
