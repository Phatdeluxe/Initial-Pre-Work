// you can get a specific character in a string by using bracket notation. you follow the variable name with brackets around a number. The numbers start counting from 0 up, so the first letter in a string would be index 0

// Example
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];

// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];
