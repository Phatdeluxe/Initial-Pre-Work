// uninitialized variables will be initalized by default with undefined. For numbers this will show up a NaN (Not a Number). for strings this will literally be "undefined". Also when initalizing a variable with text you need to wrap the text in quotation marks.

// Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";

// Do not change code below this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
